# TextJobs
Connect job recruiters to youth facing barriers via SMS ðŸ“² Built with Rails 4.2.2 and [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/).

## Inspiration
My sister-in-law, Neha, was interviewing candidates for an open internship role at her organization. After she made her decision, she emailed the candidate with the great news that she was hired. However, the candidate hadn't responded after several days. Neha became worried that she was no longer interested and considered giving the role to someone else, but decided to text her directly just to make sure. Seconds later, the candidate responded full of excitement and gladly accepted the position. She hadn't seen the email because she can only check it every few days on the computer at her school's library.

This example is one of many. Many youth in the Greater Toronto Area and around the globe don't have access to a computer at home, nor have data plans on their phones. Thus, it is difficult for them to access and seek out new job opportunities. Recruiters need a way to reach these youth directly, and SMS is a great tool to do that.

TextJobs is a simple proof of concept with immense possibility.
